## 🐇 Structure

> The Generator folder contains the following files:



### ⚙️ generatorData.json [bin/core/generator/generatorData.json]

- A setup file in the form of JSON where the actual name of the overwatch workshop function is recorded. The function names of the type-script implementer on the engine are all made up of `camel-case`, but the actual overwatch workshop function names are all made up of `pascal-case` and need to be converted to the actual function name.



### 🔖 reformerData.json [bin/core/generator/reformerData.json]

- A JSON-type setup file that groups functions (like functions with similar parameters) and contains information about what to classify. (Reformer is classifies functions that are implementations of the workshop interface to make it more convenient for engine users.)
- `independent` refers to static functions, and `dependence` refers to functions that can be used after class instance is created.



### 🌠 initializer.ts [bin/core/generator/initializer.ts]

- A command script that runs when you run the command `npm run generate:silent` The script creates the `release` folder if the user does not have the `release` folder when the engine was first started.
- `npm run generate:silent` is a command that is executed automatically when the engine is started through `npm start` and `npm run build` and so on, so general developers do not have to use it.



### 🚀 index.ts [bin/core/generator/resolver.ts]

- `npm run generate` This is a command script that runs when you run the command. This script automatically creates all practical implementations. The script inserts a translation into the interface comment through the `inject.ts` that exists on the Language folder, and creates a practical implementer file through the `resolver.ts`.
- The `npm run generate` command is used to help core developers modify core data.



### 👨🏻‍✈️  resolver.ts [bin/core/generator/resolver.ts]

- A script containing functions that sequentially execute the functions that create the implementations of the workshop interface. This script runs and controls all creation processes step by step.



### 📐 interface.ts [bin/core/generator/util.ts]

- When the script `resolver.ts` executes functions sequentially, it contains an interface of data that will be used between each function.



### 👩🏻‍🏭 generator.ts [bin/core/generator/generator.ts]

- This script contains a function that automatically creates the implementations of the workshop interface. `Event`, `Value`, `Action ` interfaces the implementations of the files are generated by the functions contained in this script.



### 👩🏻‍🔧 sequence/`*`.ts [bin/core/generator/sequence/`*`.ts]

- This script contains the detailed functions required to create the implementations of the workshop interface. This script contains functions that collect function information, analyze the Typescript grammar, or create Type implementations.



### 👩🏻‍🎨 reformer.ts [bin/core/generator/reformer.ts]

- A script that classifies functions that are implemented in a workshop interface by type (with similar parameters of function) among functions so that engine users can write them more conveniently



### 🔧 util.ts [bin/core/generator/util.ts]

- A script that contains the functions required for the generator implementation.



### 💽 logger.ts [bin/core/generator/logger.ts]

- A logger script that prints messages on the CLI screen and logs messages from the engine in file format in the `temp` folder provided by the OS.
