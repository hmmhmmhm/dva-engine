## ⚠️ Warning

> These interface files relate to the most primitive overwatch workshop function structure.

- Modifying the interface directly to add a new function is not recommended. See **<u>CONTRIBUTING.md</u>** for instructions on how to add a function. (There is a maintenance script execution method for adding a function.)



## ✅ Exact timing of modification

- When a function has been added through a maintenance script, a direct interface modification must be performed if a specific interface file is prompted to be modified.
- If an error message is output stating that a particular interface has a problem while the engine is running, the interface file must be modified.
- For issues that cannot be handled through maintenance scripts, direct interface modifications should be made.
