>  ðŸŒº (WIP) Overwatch Workshop Ruleset with JavaScript



## Why?

The ruleset of an overwatch workshop can be modified by default only within the game. However, in the ruleset editor in the game, many of the features used by existing developers through IDE are not available.

## How?

That is why the overwatch-workshop-javascript is being developed. Overwatch's workshop code is saved as an extension file called .ows, and the editor code can be extracted or inserted through copy and paste from the editor. The goal is to redefine the code of these existing .ows files as typescript interface and run them on the web through monaco web editor.

## What?

First of all, we want to make it possible to obtain the overwatch workshop code through typed or javascript coding on the web. This process will provide automatic completion or exposure to interface descriptions so that even those who do not know javascript can easily use the basic grammar with a little knowledge.

Secondly, we want to provide visual scripting such as Unreal Engine. A great visual scripting engine, Rete.js, helps people without programming knowledge to express logic structures just by drawing and connecting nodes. These Rete.js are intended to allow you to define all the conditions and values of the Overwatch.
