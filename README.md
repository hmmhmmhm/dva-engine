> **DVA-ENGINE**: Transfiler engine for advanced developers.



## 💬 Why?

The ruleset of an overwatch workshop can be modified by default only within the game. for this reason, IDE with many functions is not available. (This is certainly not good news for modern developers.)

## 💭 How?

That is why the **<u>D.VA Engine</u>** (Before name: **<u>overwatch-workshop-javascript</u>**) is being developed. Overwatch's workshop code is saved as an extension file called `.ows`, and the editor code can be extracted or inserted through copy and paste from the editor. The goal is to redefine the code of these existing `.ows` files as typescript interface and run them on the web editor.

> D.Va Engine has been written of 100% Typescript!



## 💡 What?

We purposed to make it possible to obtain the overwatch workshop code through typed or javascript coding on the web. This process will be provide automatic completion or exposure to interface descriptions so that even those who do not know javascript can easily use the basic grammar with a little knowledge.
